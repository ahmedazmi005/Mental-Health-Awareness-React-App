    <h1>Mental Health Awareness</h1>  
    <strong>This website was created with the goal to destigmatize mental illness and spread awareness by providing an easy to access directory of several mental health disorders that people go through and resources to learn more. Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood - and being aware of what other people go through can help us all understand and support each other.
    </strong>
    <p>Note: Please understand that this list is not exhaustive and although these descriptions were written to be as accurate as possible, mental illnesses are nuanced. It is encouraged to use the links provided to learn more.</p>
