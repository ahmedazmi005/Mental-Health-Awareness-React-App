## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was really challenging to get started, to be honest. However, I started by initializing the app through vite, then looking at the lab and session slides/recording from day 1. It helped me get started, then I thought about how I would set up the components and style it to look like a card. Once I got that down (which took me a couple hours lol) I moved on to making the component modular and reusable, by giving it props! After that, the challenges were mainly CSS related (getting everything centered and positioned how I wanted it). The actual react concepts used in this project were relatively simple and straightforward!
